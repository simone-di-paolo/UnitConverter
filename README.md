# Unit Converter - Android Kotlin

Project Description:

This repository contains a simple exercise app for unit conversion in order to learn Kotlin. 
Users can enter a numerical value and select the input and output units of measurement. 
The app will convert the value to the selected unit and display it.

This exercise has been developed by following the Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-developer/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING">The Complete Android 14 & Kotlin Development Masterclass</a>
with some small changes made on my side.
